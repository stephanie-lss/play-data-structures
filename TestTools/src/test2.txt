IT is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."

Mr. Bennet made no answer.

"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.

"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."

This was invitation enough.

"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."

"What is his name?"

"Bingley."

"Is he married or single?"

"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"

"How so? how can it affect them?"

"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."

"Is that his design in settling here?"

"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."

"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for, as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."

"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."

"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."

"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."

"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."

"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."

"Oh! one moment!" said Rodolphe. "Do not let us go! Stay!"
He drew her farther on to a small pool where duckweeds made a
greenness on the water. Faded water lilies lay motionless between
the reeds. At the noise of their steps in the grass, frogs jumped away
to hide themselves.
"I am wrong! I am wrong!" she said. "I am mad to listen to you!"
"Why? Emma! Emma!"
"Oh, Rodolphe!" said the young woman slowly, leaning on his
shoulder.
The cloth of her habit caught against the velvet of his coat. She
threw back her white neck, swelling with a sigh, and faltering, in
tears, with a long shudder and hiding her face, she gave herself up to
him—
The shades of night were falling; the horizontal sun passing
between the branches dazzled the eyes. Here and there around her,
in the leaves or on the ground, trembled luminous patches, as it
hummingbirds flying about had scattered their feathers. Silence was
everywhere; something sweet seemed to come forth from the trees;
she felt her heart, whose beating had begun again, and the blood
coursing through her flesh like a stream of milk. Then far away,
beyond the wood, on the other hills, she heard a vague prolonged
cry, a voice which lingered, and in silence she heard it mingling like
music with the last pulsations of her throbbing nerves. Rodolphe, a
cigar between his lips, was mending with his penknife one of the two
broken bridles.
They returned to Yonville by the same road. On the mud they saw
again the traces of their horses side by side, the same thickets, the
same stones to the grass; nothing around them seemed changed; and
yet for her something had happened more stupendous than if the
mountains had moved in their places. Rodolphe now and again bent
forward and took her hand to kiss it.She was charming on horseback—upright, with her slender waist,
her knee bent on the mane of her horse, her face somewhat flushed
by the fresh air in the red of the evening.
On entering Yonville she made her horse prance in the road.
People looked at her from the windows.
At dinner her husband thought she looked well, but she pretended
not to hear him when he inquired about her ride, and she remained
sitting there with her elbow at the side of her plate between the two
lighted candles.
"Emma!" he said.
"What?"
"Well, I spent the afternoon at Monsieur Alexandre's. He has an
old cob, still very fine, only a little broken-kneed, and that could be
bought; I am sure, for a hundred crowns." He added, "And thinking
it might please you, I have bespoken it—bought it. Have I done
right? Do tell me?"
She nodded her head in assent; then a quarter of an hour later—
"Are you going out to-night?" she asked.
"Yes. Why?"
"Oh, nothing, nothing, my dear!"
And as soon as she had got rid of Charles she went and shut
herself up in her room.
At first she felt stunned; she saw the trees, the paths, the ditches,
Rodolphe, and she again felt the pressure of his arm, while the
leaves rustled and the reeds whistled.
But when she saw herself in the glass she wondered at her face.
Never had her eyes been so large, so black, of so profound a depth.
Something subtle about her being transfigured her. She repeated, "I
have a lover! a lover!" delighting at the idea as if a second puberty
had come to her. So at last she was to know those joys of love, that
fever of happiness of which she had despaired! She was entering
upon marvels where all would be passion, ecstasy, delirium. An
azure infinity encompassed her, the heights of sentiment sparkledunder her thought, and ordinary existence appeared only afar off,
down below in the shade, through the interspaces of these heights.
Then she recalled the heroines of the books that she had read, and
the lyric legion of these adulterous women began to sing in her
memory with the voice of sisters that charmed her. She became
herself, as it were, an actual part of these imaginings, and realised
the love-dream of her youth as she saw herself in this type of
amorous women whom she had so envied. Besides, Emma felt a
satisfaction of revenge. Had she not suffered enough? But now she
triumphed, and the love so long pent up burst forth in full joyous
bubblings. She tasted it without remorse, without anxiety, without
trouble.
The day following passed with a new sweetness. They made vows
to one another She told him of her sorrows. Rodolphe interrupted
her with kisses; and she looking at him through half-closed eyes,
asked him to call her again by her name—to say that he loved her
They were in the forest, as yesterday, in the shed of some
woodenshoe maker. The walls were of straw, and the roof so low
they had to stoop. They were seated side by side on a bed of dry
leaves.
From that day forth they wrote to one another regularly every
evening. Emma placed her letter at the end of the garden, by the
river, in a fissure of the wall. Rodolphe came to fetch it, and put
another there, that she always found fault with as too short.
One morning, when Charles had gone out before day break, she
was seized with the fancy to see Rodolphe at once. She would go
quickly to La Huchette, stay there an hour, and be back again at
Yonville while everyone was still asleep. This idea made her pant
with desire, and she soon found herself in the middle of the field,
walking with rapid steps, without looking behind her.
Day was just breaking. Emma from afar recognised her lover's
house. Its two dove-tailed weathercocks stood out black against the
pale dawn.
Beyond the farmyard there was a detached building that she
thought must be the chateau She entered—it was if the doors at her
approach had opened wide of their own accord. A large straight
staircase led up to the corridor. Emma raised the latch of a door, andsuddenly at the end of the room she saw a man sleeping. It was
Rodolphe. She uttered a cry.
"You here? You here?" he repeated. "How did you manage to
come? Ah! your dress is damp."
"I love you," she answered, throwing her arms about his neck.
This first piece of daring successful, now every time Charles went
out early Emma dressed quickly and slipped on tiptoe down the
steps that led to the waterside.
But when the plank for the cows was taken up, she had to go by
the walls alongside of the river; the bank was slippery; in order not
to fall she caught hold of the tufts of faded wallflowers. Then she
went across ploughed fields, in which she sank, stumbling; and
clogging her thin shoes. Her scarf, knotted round her head, fluttered
to the wind in the meadows. She was afraid of the oxen; she began
to run; she arrived out of breath, with rosy cheeks, and breathing
out from her whole person a fresh perfume of sap, of verdure, of the
open air. At this hour Rodolphe still slept. It was like a spring
morning coming into his room.
The yellow curtains along the windows let a heavy, whitish light
enter softly. Emma felt about, opening and closing her eyes, while
the drops of dew hanging from her hair formed, as it were, a topaz
aureole around her face. Rodolphe, laughing, drew her to him, and
pressed her to his breast.
Then she examined the apartment, opened the drawers of the
tables, combed her hair with his comb, and looked at herself in his
shaving-glass. Often she even put between her teeth the big pipe that
lay on the table by the bed, amongst lemons and pieces of sugar near
a bottle of water.
It took them a good quarter of an hour to say goodbye. Then
Emma cried. She would have wished never to leave Rodolphe.
Something stronger than herself forced her to him; so much so, that
one day, seeing her come unexpectedly, he frowned as one put out.
"What is the matter with you?" she said. "Are you ill? Tell me!"
At last he declared with a serious air that her visits were becoming
imprudent—that she was compromising herself.Chapter Ten
Gradually Rodolphe's fears took possession of her. At first, love
had intoxicated her; and she had thought of nothing beyond. But
now that he was indispensable to her life, she feared to lose anything
of this, or even that it should be disturbed. When she came back
from his house she looked all about her, anxiously watching every
form that passed in the horizon, and every village window from
which she could be seen. She listened for steps, cries, the noise of
the ploughs, and she stopped short, white, and trembling more than
the aspen leaves swaying overhead.
One morning as she was thus returning, she suddenly thought she
saw the long barrel of a carbine that seemed to be aimed at her. It
stuck out sideways from the end of a small tub half-buried in the
grass on the edge of a ditch. Emma, half-fainting with terror,
nevertheless walked on, and a man stepped out of the tub like a
Jack-in-the-box. He had gaiters buckled up to the knees, his cap
pulled down over his eyes, trembling lips, and a red nose. It was
Captain Binet lying in ambush for wild ducks.
"You ought to have called out long ago!" he exclaimed; "When one
sees a gun, one should always give warning."
The tax-collector was thus trying to hide the fright he had had, for
a prefectorial order having prohibited duckhunting except in boats,
Monsieur Binet, despite his respect for the laws, was infringing
them, and so he every moment expected to see the rural guard turn
up. But this anxiety whetted his pleasure, and, all alone in his tub,
he congratulated himself on his luck and on his cuteness. At sight of
Emma he seemed relieved from a great weight, and at once entered
upon a conversation.
"It isn't warm; it's nipping."
Emma answered nothing. He went on—
"And you're out so early?""Yes," she said stammering; "I am just coming from the nurse
where my child is."
"Ah! very good! very good! For myself, I am here, just as you see
me, since break of day; but the weather is so muggy, that unless one
had the bird at the mouth of the gun—"
"Good evening, Monsieur Binet," she interrupted him, turning on
her heel.
"Your servant, madame," he replied drily; and he went back into
his tub.
Emma regretted having left the tax-collector so abruptly. No doubt
he would form unfavourable conjectures. The story about the nurse
was the worst possible excuse, everyone at Yonville knowing that the
